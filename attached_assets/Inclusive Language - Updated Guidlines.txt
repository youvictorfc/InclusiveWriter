Using inclusive language in writing ensures that your content respects diversity and avoids
reinforcing stereotypes or biases. Here are some key strategies:
1. Use Gender-Neutral Language
- Instead of chairman, use chairperson or chair.
- Replace policeman with police officer.
- Use they/them when a person’s gender is unknown or irrelevant (e.g., Each employee
should submit their report instead of his report).
2. Avoid Ableist Language
- Say accessible parking instead of handicapped parking.
- Use person with a disability rather than disabled person, unless the individual prefers
identity-first language.
- Replace phrases like falling on deaf ears or turning a blind eye with alternatives like being
ignored or overlooked.
3. Use Culturally Inclusive Terms
- Instead of foreigner, use international visitor or non-citizen resident.
- Avoid terms that stereotype ethnic or cultural groups (e.g., tribal knowledge → shared
knowledge).
- When discussing Indigenous groups, use their specific names (e.g., Wurundjeri people of the
Kulin Nation) rather than generalising.
4. Respect Personal Identities
- Ask for and use a person’s correct pronouns.
- Use spouse or partner instead of assuming husband/wife.
- Avoid outdated terms like transgendered, and use a transgender person instead.
5. Use Person-First or Identity-First Language Thoughtfully
- In general, prioritise person with a disability over disabled person, unless an individual or
community prefers identity-first language (e.g., Deaf community).
- Avoid defining people by their condition (e.g., a person with schizophrenia, not a
schizophrenic).
6. Be Mindful of Socioeconomic Bias
- Avoid assumptions about income, education, or lifestyle (e.g., parents should provide books at
home → schools and communities should ensure children have access to books).
- Use low-income households instead of the poor.
7. Ensure Readability and Accessibility
- Use plain language to make content clear and understandable.
- Avoid jargon, or explain it when necessary.
- Provide alternative text for images and captions for videos.
8. Ethnic and Cultural Sensitivity: NOMW flags potentially insensitive references to ethnicity,
race, or culture and suggests alternatives that are more respectful and inclusive.
9. Disability Awareness: The tool promotes disability awareness by highlighting instances where
language or terminology may unintentionally perpetuate stereotypes or stigmas related to
disabilities.
10. LGBTQ+ Inclusivity: NOMW encourages the use of inclusive language when referring to
LGBTQ+ individuals and issues, helping writers avoid unintentional marginalisation.
11. Inclusive Pronouns: The tool provides guidance on using inclusive pronouns like "they/them"
and "ze/hir" to acknowledge and respect non-binary and gender-diverse individuals.
12. Diverse Representation: NOMW encourages writers to include diverse perspectives, voices,
and experiences in their content to reflect a broader range of backgrounds and identities.
13. Cultural Appropriation Awareness: It helps users recognise instances of cultural
appropriation in their writing and provides guidance on how to avoid perpetuating harmful
stereotypes.
14. Must not assume old-fashioned views about women in the home, community or work.
