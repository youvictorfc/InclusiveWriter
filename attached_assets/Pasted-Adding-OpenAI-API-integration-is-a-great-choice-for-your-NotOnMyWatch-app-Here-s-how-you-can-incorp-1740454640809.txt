Adding OpenAI API integration is a great choice for your NotOnMyWatch app. Here's how you can incorporate it:
OpenAI API Integration
API Implementation

Use OpenAI's GPT models via their API
Implement API key authentication system for users
Set up proper rate limiting and usage monitoring

Model Selection

GPT-4 or latest available model for most accurate inclusive language analysis
Use fine-tuning capabilities to specialize in inclusive language detection
Implement different prompt strategies for each mode (Writing/Policy/Recruitment)

Prompt Engineering

Design specialized prompts for each analysis mode
Include inclusive guidelines in system prompts
Structure user prompts to include both the text and required analysis type

Technical Architecture

Frontend sends text and selected mode to backend
Backend formats appropriate OpenAI API call with specialized prompt
API returns analysis with problematic sections identified
Backend processes and structures this data
Frontend displays the structured feedback to user

Response Processing

Parse OpenAI's response to extract:

Non-inclusive language instances
Suggested alternatives
Explanations for why changes are recommended


Format response data for highlighting in the UI

Performance Optimization

Implement caching for common phrases and corrections
Use batched API calls for longer documents
Stream responses for large documents to show progressive results

Cost Management

Implement token counting to estimate API costs
Create usage tiers for different user levels
Optimize prompts to reduce token usage while maintaining quality

Fallback Systems

Implement a basic rule-based system as backup
Create offline mode with cached common corrections
Error handling for API outages or quota limits

Would you like me to develop any specific aspects of the OpenAI integration in more detail? For example, I could sketch out example prompts for each mode or suggest specific model parameters that would optimize for inclusive language analysis.
